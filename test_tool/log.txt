First response didn't show tool-call. Second probe also ambiguous.

--- Conclusion ---
❌ No evidence of tool calling in this response.
Possible reasons: provider doesn't expose tool-calling, model chosen doesn't support it, or extra flags are required.

Great, that's a direct match for the user's request. Now, let's look at the ping tool's spec. Hmm, no arguments needed – easy. So, it's straight forward: create the JSON for the tool call. It will be a \"tool_calls\" object, with a single entry. This entry is of \"type\" \"function\" and the \"function\" object will specify \"name\" as \"ping\", and the \"arguments\" will be an empty object, because this ping command needs no parameters. Here's the final JSON.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's see. The user wants me to run the `ping` tool, which is straightforward enough.  I recall that `ping` doesn't actually take any arguments. Therefore, I'll need to build a JSON object to represent the tool call.\n\nI need to specify the tool name, which is `ping`, and the arguments, which will be an empty object `{}` in this case.  The overall structure is: a JSON object containing a `tool_calls` array, where the array contains an object describing the function call. \n\nSpecifically, it looks like this: `{\"tool_calls\":[{\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"<tool_name>\",\"arguments\":{...}}}]}`.  So, substituting in the specifics: `<tool_name>` is `ping` and `{...}` becomes `{}`.\n\nThe resulting, properly formatted JSON output I need to generate is: `{\"tool_calls\":[{\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"ping\",\"arguments\":{}}}]}`.  That's it. No extraneous text, just the JSON.\n"
